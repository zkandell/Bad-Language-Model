This folder will contain major checkpoints in the project. Each will be a folder that contains the working playground.py code, as well as all of the files that you need in order to run that code successfully. This will be much less common than the snapshots, which is closer to a daily diary of where the code is at the moment. The checkpoints will be more stable and reliable, and will show the major milestones in the project. In fact, they are likely to be more stable and reliable than the main playground.py file, as that is where all of the messy development work is done.
