The idea: experiment with creating a language model from very basic, but flawed components. This is a learning experience, not anything I expect to ever really work. 

This is not going to be a good language model - it's in the name, Bad Language Model. I don't know if I'm using the right techniques or terminology. I'm just a hobbyist who likes to play with code and might know enough to be dangerous. 

I'm a firm believer in reinvention as a learning tool. I've learned a lot by trying to build things from scratch, and while this might just end up being a weird curiosity, having worked through some of the problems myself on this very low, basic level will help me understand the more complex tools and techniques that are out there.

That's the idea, anyway.
